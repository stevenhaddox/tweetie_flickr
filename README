For use with Tweetie 2 and its new custom image service
http://developer.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/custom-image

This is originally forked from ebonical's tweetie_flickr project on github:
http://github.com/ebonical/tweetie_flickr

This version has been modified to utilize Twitter OAuth for user authent-
ication. It only makes sense as anyone using this should have a Twitter
account.

Flickr4Twitter (@flickr4tw1tter) merely serves as a way to upload images
from Tweetie 2 to Flickr.com after you have authenticated with both 
services. There are plans for future clients, APIs, and a better user-
interface in the near future.

Flickr4Twitter is an open-source project and you are more than welcome
to run your own version on your own server if you prefer. I'd love it if
you let me know if you use it.

Check list
==========

Create a user with twitter credentials
- if User#test_user is true then photos will be private (for testing)

Get Flickr user ID - try here http://idgettr.com
You can also use @user.get_flickr_id(flickr_username)

Get Flickr API key+secret
Put these into config/flickr.yml
Authenticate your Flickr account for write access
Get your token and store it against the user record

Authorize the application via Twitter's OAuth for user management.

Set a secret session key for Rails in config/secret
- use `rake secret` to get a new key

POST to https://your-domain.com/photos.xml

Tweetie will send
:username
:password
